    <p> Hello everyone! after finishing my homework. I like to enjoy my free time in doing curricural activities like dancing , singing , playing and craft. But my favorite hobby is craft. I enjoyed it very much. I have made many things. For doing we also need patience as if thing is big it will take time and make that things only which make you happy. It makes my mind relaxed and we need some tools also like siccor , paper , tape etc. So, this is about my favorite hobby. Thanks for your time.</p>
